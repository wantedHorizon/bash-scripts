to make an alias to run command without ./


run in your terminal 

make files executable
1)
chmod 755 path/unpack
chmod 755 path/psping



*path= full path to files unpack/psping
2)
alias unpack= "*path/unpack"
alias psping= "*path/psping"


enjoy!


------------------------------------------------------
NOTES!
-------
-------

task 0:
-------
I changed unpack to decompress files to path /extracted
to avoid repeated overwrittes


task 2:
-------
works as expected
It checks periodically if a specific executable has a
live process. 


--------------------------------------
i tried to make a script that adds alias but its limited to  script lifetime
: '


 shopt -s expand_aliases

loc="$(pwd)"
echo $loc


 alias psping="./$loc/psping"
 alias unpck="./$loc/unpack"
